To be honest, I am not sure.  I would guess maybe an ottoman.  It is a gift that my daughter wants for Christmas and I only have a picture.  Quite honestly, it looks like a trash can, but she loves it!
Maybe that is what this would be classified as.  Could I see a picture of the item?
Yes! You are a great assistant, this is exactly what I am searching for. Could you provide the dimensions for this end table?
Yes, this will be a great gift for her.  I was worried that I would not be able to find the item. What is the price?
